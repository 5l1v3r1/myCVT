Checkpoint Firewall Ruleset Auditor 
( For those shitty HTMLexports that a client gives you for Firewall Ruleset Reviews )

This has been created out of frustration of Checkpoint firewall reviews. Whilst nipper-ng is great 
thanks to Ian Ventura Whiting, it doesnt support HTML Checkpoint Firewall exports. Although, I dont 
blame him for not doing it.

It should be useful for any pentesters or auditors looking to quickly highlight rules which have
"Any" "Any" 's and "Disabled" in the relevant sections :)

Pretty much in alpha stage, let one of us know if you find any bugs, willing to improve it!
